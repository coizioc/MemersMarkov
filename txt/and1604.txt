1 sqaure from puzzle being done and fucking crash

charts wrong!!!
the data has been corrupted
do you get more slayer pts from doing tasks after smoking kills
fuck me no wonder ive been getting 7 pts a task
smoothest game ever honestly
mw2 was just classic tho
no other game did that shit and made it mainstream yet
so easy to play online
although i remember if you get ac130 on mw2 you could literally just bomb team spawn on favella
i dont wanna know how many hours on rs
like thirteen years i bet its wild
your prob max tho right
feel that, 3 99s and i got them all in the last 6 months, had this acc since 2006
ye i cant do everything im p limited
i always get busy cause of school and shit
i wish i could see just how much of it was afk time lol i bet over half
for me atleast
just doing some dumb shit like wc
whatd he do in first place
lol game went from 12 year olds scamming to 30 y/o manipulating armies
fortnite more fun imo
i just like it cause everyone at OU plays it lol
me and all 3 my roomates come back from bars and play it, great social game
mfw 12 top 5's and died everytime
mostly cause my roomates are dipshits and we play squad
fuck that i drop in with an ult for a team kill and some fucking turd just ults me first
back when reaper was op i'd just tele into middle of team and ult
genji is a little fuck
so elusive and so annoying
TF2 not so much COD i get because stupid hsit happens alllll the time
COD is bc it literally is out of your hands half the time
game launch was worst ive ever seen
fucking lagging, disconnecting after waiting 20 mins to join game
etc
honestly black ops i loved online for all of them besides first
your either gonna escape or your not no matter what like when i get mobbed by a clan i know
im prob gonna die
i got it down p good but when its like 20 people ranging you eh
i like watching like 3-4 try to kill people pretty entertaining, you can tell they dont usually pk
like you said surge into wall or tree, or just flat out get outrun
you're part of the group thats successful, i feel like 50% of wb attempts are just ass
numbers game for them i feel like
i was about to say they usually mob
they dont kill leeches and ish tho, and i thought they didnt even require people to stay and fight other fcs
ye
yeah syndicate does, i meant fc
all about  that leech
bet he could get more $$ for that name than for a maxed acc at this point
just join warbands fc like pk if your scared of getting killed
honestly i solo and just bring 3 pieces of food
i've died to clans handful of times, its pretty easy to escape if you do dwf only
tru but most of the time i feel like
lol when i was a kid i botted and shit, game sucks when you get everything w no effort, took me like 10 years to come back after ban and rollback bc i was that bored by the time it happened

do you think i could use a windows emulator to run alt 1 on runescape while using a mac
eh im honestly so lazy i dont think i'll do either option lol
althought i feel like me getting a kinnect robot motor to push the arrow key would work
literally have no idea how to make it go up and down but this is all pretty hypothetical
id also have to go buy one which is just too much for me when thinking about what it would be for
ffs does spotlight just make every minigame aids
you think if i just put a weight on my keyboard i'd stay logged in
fuck how can i hack this
leave myself at rift for assload of time
pretty much not even playing rn just watching tv or doing other stuff, but it keeps logging me out when i leave for like 10 mins
GE rift for summoning
my lazyness is getting crazy rn
seriously just considered buying like a kids robot toy to press a button or something
i am master hacker
wouldnt they just detect that though lol
so today i said something to a troll
heres a litttle taste of the last 30 minutes, havent responded besides once to say yeah üòÉ

im just very impressed with his consistency considering no one has talked to him for so long
he called me a transexual disabled midget and i said i was one and he stfu
?????
this guy is literally insane
for the last 10 mins he has just been making up that me and these two girls are pming him
and having a full blown conversation in public chat
with himself
i think he would bomb someone if that happened
he just left, his sign off was a rant about hitler and "siege hiel"
his music is kind of good some of it atleast, i dont blame him
i dont watch alot of his shit but from what i saw he seemed like it was just a character to get famous off of lol
lets get gaster in front of hte camera and get youtube famous
3 hours bit ch
set your resolutions now or they dont count
the end is near

where it was like this did not age well
and it was an add from rs twitter and like 5/7 things they had on there they didnt complete and the caption was like "rs3 getting all this in 2017, sign up now"
