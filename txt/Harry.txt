Killing spiders is good
Or <@!215610241834811393> with achto?
Not if he does it again
Yea gl on all titles without kk mhmm
He is screwed
It's schep what do u expect
Can't get rng on tess can't get rng on dps hits
Kril is a scam
9000 kc 6 pets btw
My 16 sec was before invention lol
In death lotus
Free btw
I have one with 80%
Cost me 290m lul
Mine was 290m without perks smh
Title update op
My gold acc picked up 6m yesterday at krill only lol
Worth
Gz on tess
Nah I cleared my drop list
And after krill I looked how many coins were on it
It does
Nah I did 5 hours
Hardmode
But that's 6m I woulda left on the floor lol
It defo tracks coins
Didn't reset before going?
Ez money
Normal mode is probs more than hardmode since faster kills
Schep will be one of those people that don't get pet till 3000 kc
Liberator when?
Nice achto
At least get legio title
Easy af
Easy
I'm just over 2000kc with both added
Pet today btw
That too
It's ok idm lol
Get a lot of xp
And Mage pet
My hand did ache after 4 hours tho smh
But vind has 2 pets
But 2x chance of receiving one earlier than the other gwd2 bosses
Since you have 2 pet roles
Schep that will be me btw
I know
But if they are 1/2000 each
It's 1/1000 of getting one of them
Yes Ik
But 1/2000 rolled twice per kill
1/1000 chance of getting one of the pets
Yes
After you get one it will be 1/2000
I can see
Only 1 pet in gwd+2 combined btw
Close to ifb
Kbd on 854 btw
<@!215610241834811393> I will get tess first btw and I'm not even going to telos
Dry on krill btw
Gave me wrong pet
I've done 700 hardmode in the last few days tho
It was at 70 btw smh
I have thresholds btw
How does it know how many I have? Mhm
Normal mode and hardmode add together
Pet is 1/333 for me in hm
Hardmode is 1/1000 base no thresholds
So 2000 normal mode will make it 3/1000

Well not like he was fast? 1 year for lvl 119-120
Who uses bots when there is spins smh
Yeh ofc
I don't even use snapchat so
