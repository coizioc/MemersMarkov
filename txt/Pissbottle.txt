LADIES
What do I do
Just got 90 magic
YEah
fully proud of myself boys
Doing desert treasure now
disgustingly long quest
Prime bullying targets in world 100 then
tbh gonna go hack some maxed level 3 skiller and rob his bank
then use it to buy 99 prayer and herblore xxx
hold up
how
where
teach me
whens next wbs
I need the herb xp
1h 33
Faaak
How are you meant to do it solo
my discord crashed
rip
where do I go to do that tuska shit
that DPS boost would be nice
What's fastest magic XP rn?
Abyss?
Tried doing the quests and got bored
I need blood barrage ideally
but fuck the quest
it's long af
not curses
ancients
yeye  I get you
Fuck agility
70
I thought I wanted reflects
For solo vind
That's even worse lol
92 prayer is expensive as tit
tits
fml
gonna quit and become a skiller xddddd
Hold up
gaster's a level 3 skiller
I was gonna say
level 3 skilling is a stupid idea
where do you spend your money
MORE SKILLING SUPPLIES
What does it drop from
gorv isn;t it
That's NEARLY possible
need the prayer level
wdym
am i missing something here
oh
Never done it
Don't I need 85 to enter?
what about ciwyr wand?
Double dps effectively
shit yea
Yeah
I wanna try helwyr for the pet
Was hyped for 75 slayer but then I realised I don't have the points for fast killing blows on gargs
I did vindicta with walla
doesn't seem THAT bad
What should I go kill guys
Dead that
ok mami
MIAMI
Getting 70 prayer first
Then 85 attack
then gonna go fuck twin furies
Apparently it's possible but not optimal
How do you do wbs without getting bummed
Really need that herblore xp
Might just pay some asians to level my account
20 dorrah
20 dorrah wun level
Is 90 the point I stop worrying about levelling and worry about gear?
I'll get them eventually
99 magic will make me suicidal though
Is nox staff my endpoint?
is markdonalds still bannable
Can someone take me for my first vindicta kill?
Ready for vind ;0
Cheq
voice boi
What are you guys even doing in voice
For farming sacrifice
Do you use a friends chat or group with lootshare enabled
I thought it was only the aviancies that dropped them
I can't get them, ffs
Someone help me farm this bloody ability
need it for slayer
Just got it
After someone I have on my friendslist told me that lootshare does nothing
created a new group, enabled lootshare and got it in 3 kills
All I need now is the mazcab codex
12 MILL
WOT
Are they that good to sell shit for?
Corruption blast is what I'm after
But the 12mil could sort me for hours in the abyss
Always get shitty tasks
What do they do
Should I get 75 and then prefer gargs
Just wanna know what's most optimal
being as I've just farmed out a couple abilities that will help me out
Both
I wanna start bossing as fast as possible though
it seems SO fun
Like I don't want to have to worry about combat stats
I want to worry about what gear I'm using and what buyable skills I need to push
I'll get proper ragged at warbands
Think I could start doing warbands?
Alrighty
Do I need to be on a lootshare world to get the gwd abilitys
This is taking forever
hol up
how
most money methods are like 5m/h
slayer task with no food
weeeey
buying bonds
How much would I get if I bought one
the full 17mil?
<@!219515657153282048> at turoths atm
15 more kills
<@!219515657153282048> menaphos bank
tytyty
Cinderbane gloves
what level do you need to equip them
and do they degrade
im lazy
Why why
I find it fun
poorboyproblems though
low level moneymaking is shitty
Gimme your cashstack then ;0
Why are you still playing then
how is that a reason to play
wot
Oh lmao
Oh hol u
up
chilling w/ full subjugation
why
Weapons I'm using SOL
just to slayerdart turoths
Melee I have bandos and a whip
and ranged I use royal dhide and dh cbows
Apparently I have silverhawk boots
how do I use them
How do I cop feathers
I have 0 charges
Charges = XP right
Oh shit
31k you mean
Oh
I'm 36 agil
training is boring
Far, fancy buying me 99 mage? ‚ù§
I'm lazy and wanna abyss it
Questing bores me so I wanna be able to rag on bosses as fast as possible
Don't have the stats for abyssals
sadly
I'm at 71 i think
my ting is
99 mage = faster kills
faster kills = faster tasks
I'm considering buying gold and using it to abyss with blood magic
A bond will get me like 14 hours in the abyss
which is enough for 99
or I could get like 30mil in 10 seconds buy spending ¬£6 on bonds
And get myself the arma set I need for ranged
Fancy buying my 92 prayer cheq dad
GASTERRR
I hate questing with a passion
Is buying gold risky af still?
Not worth buying 50mil then?
Just to start my buyable skills
That's my thing
Jagex aren't gonna ban you over ¬£5 of gold
Unless you feel like buying me 94 prayer eggplant üòâ
92 I mean
bet 95 is expensive af though
cheq lmaooo
Guys
I'm feeling lost with RS now
I don't know how to make the progress I have been making
Like I got from 60-80 magic in 5 days
I'm told 80 magic is good for some low tier bosses but I can't do them
I wanted to do the abyss but I don't know if the 1.5mil rune cost an hour is worth the XP rate
Slayer keeps giving me shitty tasks
Ideally I wanna do GWD2
quests kinda bore me
most of the ones my level have shit rewards
What stats do I need for helwyr
MOVING ON UP
sick loot my dude
tide pod ravioli
haven't tried in days
Think I'm not using the pots or skills I should be
what
avansies fucking hurt
That's what I did
Nothing dropped
The avansies hit too hard to stay there
I was gonna duo helwyr with a friend
They don't hit TOO hard, they're just a pain with 5 gangbanging me
What's Cursed Combatants
Ah
40 herblore and I'm not poor because of it
Someone do Helwyr or armadyl with me? xxxxx
you what
Trying to get someone to facetank ideally, want the abilities from arma and the chance at the armor
That works?
Will I not take damage at all?
Think it's possible with my stats
??
Yeah
Getting that now
Probably will only get 1 kill an inventory
Can still only do 1 inventory kbd afaik
Guess who's about to go commit beastiality and fuck Helwyr up
LOL
but its not gay
if you have socks on
Is agoroth worth killing for the scaled XP
bless up
<@!237295533616660481> Taking you up on that 100mil offer, slayer is boring
Should I rename myself to "I miss 2017" lmaaooo
Agility sucks ass
no u
yes u
Proof that iBill is a salty prick
Anyone feel like maxing my account for ¬£12 and a twix?
Lie
<@!185640702338793472> FINALLY GOT GWD DAD

I'm trying to get one
Being as I don't have soulsplit I think the heal at 50% adrenaline would be useful
<@!185640702338793472> What's good money making atm? Running low
meet me in wildy with all your best gear and your cashstack then
hand me your fury

He's my favourite degenerate
Never actually watched his videos
Just know he used his dad's death for ad revenue
I wanna start bossing, fml
Why does levelling take so long
powertrain?
you mean run into a room and kill everything for hours?
