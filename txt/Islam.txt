Its flawed sure
But its more valid than “osrs isnt pay2win”
Tbh treasure hunter is shitty anyway
Buying xp from treasure hunter costs 10x more than buying gp with bonds & using that for xp
Gotta be retarded to even do that tbh
Tbf. 13m in dragon bones is alot more xp than 16 keys
Mtx posts are so stupid
Legit 10 people thinking they’re the majority of runescape because they’re spamming the subreddit.
Too many clans that are trying to get me btw
Even toxic ppl want me, what 2 do

Leader of “ivy” tbh
He cant english
Thats basically every game
U can do same on osrs
Buying gp is basically buying xp on both rs and osrs
Woaw on rs3 u can buy max with 10k
With 10b on osrs ur basically maxed
A few skills u can buy
But at the same time, we got runespan
Which is basically already free 99 rc
Basically free then
Time is worthless if you are spending it on rs anyway
Irl threat btw

Quality meme?
runescape isnt the game, the game is TREASURE HUNTER
I spin on a daily basis, the rest is just some side-stuff
Neck it?
