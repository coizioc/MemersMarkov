This is the best thing ever
And never made it into the game
Yeah that's a reasonable observation
What isn't reasonable is people saying that jagex has no QA department or never tests their code or somehow schemes to make players do work for them
The irony of beta servers
Is that people really want them
But they're also a systemization of what people are accusing jagex of doing now lol
Yep
Beta servers are a good idea
Think the official response was that they don't want to spoil content though and won't do it
Like <:simba:404422608713547776>
Should I sell my lotd to buy pernix for rax
Sirenic is more expensive in the long run tho
I mean yeah that's pretty reasonable
It's only like 30m for the top and bottom that's not too bad
Still have to sell lotd to get it lol
Not gonna do that tho
I'm tired of the QA circlejerk on reddit, it's annoying af
Agreed
Reeee  how can jagex possibly have missed this bug which happens when the planets are aligned and the money in my coin pouch is a prime number
Jagex here's your weekly reminder that it's time to fix this!!
Bugs make it through to every release of everyone
Everything
We have no way of knowing how many game breaking bugs were caught by the QA team
guys i just killed rax on my first try ama

didn't even sign btw
it's pretty fun tbh
thx coiz now try rax

I'm looking for a bento box, it cant be pinku (that's Japanese for pink) or any girl color. It has to be of 2 or more kotoba (that's Japanese for 2 compartments) and has be be chibi (small) sized. And has to be really kawaii (cute). Also It has to be about 10-20 bux. And you have to post pics of it first (i want to make shure it's kawaii [cute]). And it would be nice if it came with matching chopstick holder (WITH chopsticks). OH! and it CANNOT have any cartoon pictures, or be made out of plastic. It has to be made of ceramic, or something like that. Also it would be nice if it was made in japan. and not in china or corea (Korea) or whatever. I have found a bento box similar to the one im describing in e-bay, but it was 1 kotoba, and i don't want my gohan (rice) to touch my other things (it can get wet and i would not like that, plus 2 compartments looks more kawaii)
i love that sub

go into ur own fc, turn on lootshare, and just kill regular mobs
you'll get all abilities in like 15mins
keep killing shit
you don't have to kill aviansies
any gwd1 minion drops
if you're  that weak just go do the tuska minigame
it only take like 3hrs or something to get them
also if aviansies hit too hard you're not going to even be able to get kc for helwyr tbj

<@347590230636756993> you can suggest shit for memebot
really ez to add more
who gaster?
i could do pet chances yea
i have a thing that actually checks ur adv log for shit
could put raxi in there
$pet rax
boss drops work like this
you have a start droprate, for rax it's 1/500
every time you hit a threshold of kills
so after your first 200 kills
you add 1 to the numerator of the droprate
so for kills 1-200, it's 1/500. for kills 201-300, it's 2/500
the max the numerator can go is 10
whomst did this??? <:hehe:348410848487931904> hehe <:hehe:348410848487931904>

$pet 1200 300 1500
Or something
Droprate thresh kc iirc
Bots comin back bois

The bots only show up in cap channel
Mods pls

I vote for woahmemers
<@236842111834652672> I'll add pets to telosbot later
Let me uh disable the bot saying that
Also if this makes capbot obsolete I will be v upset bc no cap raffle
Idc about the raffle just the bot lol
Guys bots going down for 24hrs
I'm moving and can't keep the laptop running

clicked and walked away
came back to this

it's the SEX NUMBER LOL
also 96 <-> 69
<@!136806558901207040> unless you know how many of your gwd kills were hardmode and how many were normal and in what order they happened, it's impossible to know your actual probability of getting the pet
Schep the reason the bot didn't work is because there was a check for your old name tendril drop smh
OK
Fuck your
DDOS
Hehe nicer one ok
:+1
;::
V
You signed
<@215610241834811393> did you get tess
Did schep get tess
Wtf
What they
You're a bot job
Did sxbep get tess
Did he tho
<@!215610241834811393> tess isn't in your alog?
whoa
it's in your alog but not here

which means theres no way the bot can no

Ok
Does schep have tess?
Wtf
I can't lol
There's no nice way to separate raxi
It's a nontrivial problem
Because I don't actually know how to do it
Schep it doesn't update immediately
How long ago did you get tess?
45 mins? Uhoh
Well pretend it works
Capbot works and it's supposed to be the same logic
!update
...
Schep you told me up write that
YOU GOT IT

chance is gone forever m8
i'm totally rewriting telos bot btw
almost done
it's way cleaner on the backend

should work properly now
$telos pet 1200
$telos 1 1 1
is deprecated
do
$telos 1% 1kc
side note
$telos pet 2100
$pet telos 2100
both work ha
üí¨ bai2u
it's replaced with $telos command
$telos help
lol
nah you didn't break it it just doesn't like u
apparently that's a division by 0 error raxi
i have a fix
also the droprate caps at 1/9 btw
can't get any higher
yeah
at least that's what the forum postsaid
the regular expression only accepts 1-5 digits
bc who tf does 6 digit kc
ok now it's any number of digits
$pet gwd1 800000
$telos 4000% 4000kc
nice
this guy in the fc is triggering me a bit
what's harps xp/hr
afk tho
how2max farming btw
mmk
time to focus on maxing üò†
that is not good
anyone have a good list of dailies?
inb4 wiki
gz skjep
I changed decimals in the pet function so they truncate even in scientific notation
$telos pet 20000
damn good show
lone digger is a gud song tho
this is my itunes library

mmk
yw
white partyhat overriden with blue partyhat

and culinaromancer's gloves lmao
no wonder you haven't gotten tess
just convert to regular account and spin it to win it tbh
just finished watching the punisher
You're not the real prezleek
Fuck
Can't be associated with that name anymore
thank god
btw is this a good rotation to learn rax?
ok
i can do ok with arma, mh asc, oh glaive right
I'll keep telos as not getting
All back to not getting
$telos pet 2000
Easier to do it this way
$telos pet 10000
Yeah I have to rewrite my significant figures thing
I just used a function I wrote for a different project
Use gwd1
$bosslist
It's not per kill chance
Also 33% would be 1 in 3
I switched to chance of getting instead of not getting
It's just 1 - {chance of not getting}
It's rounded
Unfortunately
OMG fine I'll switch it back
$pet nex 1500
üÖ±ottest2
there's only 1 now and it starts with üÖ±
üÖ±ottest
i forgot u don't need the 2
<@!381213507997270017> when will this work properly
gud
gwd1
should i switch to percent chance of getting it instead of not getting it?
$pet gwd1 2746
lolwat
oh
<@!215610241834811393> what should i get rid of

$pet gwd1 2746

Let me reboot
Idk why telosbot can't connect to the server but memebot can
does anyone have a good link for a d scimmy cursor
i got rid of chance smh
use $telos
$telos 800% 0kc
oh uh telosbot should be fixed for good now ha
my crontab was fucked up
I had it set to only reboot at midnight for some reason
let me edit the help function, I changed all the syntax
$telos 1821% 0kc
$telos help
there's some fuckery with pet chance when you start from 0 bc it's half as much
Telos bot is fucked atm
I just need to reboot but not at my laptop at the moment
Choflo
$telos pet 1500
i made it and i put it in here
well
schep put it in here
telosbot is separate from memebot
but like i host these myself
i can give you the code but you'd have to host it yourself. it's not plug and play
$pet telos 1500
1280:1024?
haha not really
naive wtf is that aspect ratio
Schep use new syntax ok
$telos 500% 36kc
Streaking is more gp/hr bc of normal loot
Unique chance is the same tho
The thing about abortion is that whether or not you agree with it the liberal line of thought is that it's left to an individual decision
Instead of the government choosing
memebot fuck off
yeah luke i gotcha
memebot FUCK OFF
maybe everything u post should go in shitposting btw
Pro labor is a core liberal value
<@237295533616660481> at least my bots make it into servers
there may be corrupt democrats but the whole "both sides are the same" meme is horseshit
lesser by like 2 orders of magnitude maybe
but not shit enough to not vote for them
there' can't be 4 political parties
bc of how many reps per district we elect
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law
yea dylie we all know
sjws are just a lou
loud vocal minority
implying sjws aren't just angry white 14 yr old girls
i didn't say small minority btw
there are a lot of them
but they don't make up the majority of the party
eli what you tryna do in politics
ofc
gl m8 u got my vote tbh
yea i actually believe you eli not memeing
whenever ur campaign starts drop a link and i'll donate 1m or so

guys you want to hear a secret
for some reason my telosbot code can't access schep's profile recently so i can't actually pull data on whether or not he has tess
i changed it dylie

FRICKING DYLIE
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
look what u made schep do
bot doesn't even enforce FRICKING swears
<@!215610241834811393> if you give my bot admin privs
i can edit messages that use f@ck to say frick instead
haha or i can edit all of cheqs messages to misspell words
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
dylie if i change the response to MOM I'M ON MANI it'll keep replying to itself lol
üò†
<:reee:358716704475447306>
i have a server that's just me and my bots
pretty lonely in there
schep since when have u been in the us military
<@237295533616660481> it's not a bug it's a feature
Can you access all of discords message history for a server
Or is it restricted
Bc I can make Markov chain bots that will talk based on chat history
Like subredditsimulator
Ye
I did it on purpose
To make it not do that the change is instead of str.find(<query>) it's str.find( <query> )
Deliberate choice
What if I do a chatbot for entire server
Not individual but everyone
Memerbot
ü§∑
<:sPride:342359982098087936>
Schep can I make a bot that deletes all of cheqs messages as soon as he posts
It's not bullying if it's cheq tho
<@!381213507997270017> when will this work
ok <@237295533616660481> i fixed it bc u complain so much
actually no fuck that too many edge cases it's fine how it is
üò†
ok
good
just in case
added
i can add new messages with a DM to the bot
nobody else can tho
but this is no swear server

welcome to woahmens!
i need to remove the luke one
because
<@!381213507997270017> when will this work right
triggers it bc the emote is named luke_emoji
i did before
shane what's ur problem
lol ez to edit

idk why W O A H M E N S doesn't work
Does anyone else like brokencyde
this is a no swears server
what the heck
$pet telos -1
$pet telos -1500
not really
i suppose i should restrict the inputs but it doesn't actually affect anything
like $chance 0 10000 1
$chance 0 10000 1
oh wait streak is first
$chance 10000 0 1
like that's never going to happen but w/e
time to write a new bot
what would be useful or interesting?
0 i guess
okay done
no way to test so you can't prove it doesn't work
i miss where if you said mani the bot would keep replying to itself

Working as intended
It's so you can say "who gay" anywhere in a message
I'm not at my computer so no I can't ha
The does schep have Tess thing isn't anywhere in the string
so if bonds are 20m each
and premier club gives 20 bonds
that's 400m?
for $80?
think i saw that in notes
oh i was g onna say
that seems wrong

destiny**
tympanic membrane is in the ear dylie
There's not even that many drops
Pulling from a website would be way harder
I got the data from sail
He also agrees it's easier to hardcode
Plus the droprates almost never change
I'll change
It's not one line of code, you'd need to parse through for all the drops you're interested in anyways
Plus the wiki doesn't even store droprates in tables, they're almost always like footnotes
it's just a json file
there's no need to do anything more
To be fair
Yeah punisher is so fucking good
Schep
Have you seen the movies raid: redemption and the raid 2
The action is really similar
Uhhh idk how to track name changes. I'll look into it
The way I calculate doesn't handle no thresh well
So just do

Well
Nvm
Jkjk
Just use $pet telos!!!
Dylie all the bosses are in there now

it was right but bot was offline
sec
ok try
$chance 36 532 0
sail brought up a good point i should write a function that'll predict chance of unique over a whole streak
like $streak <start enrage> <expected streak number>
and it'll tell you, starting at x% enrage, if you do y kills, you can expected z chance of getting a unique
wtf

$pet telos
not quite but gud try
i have my own server i'll just use that
sry
<@!215610241834811393>
$pet telos 1379
hardmode here means > 100 enr
just made it the same across the board
so like
$pet gwd1 150
almost all bosses have dif reg/hardmode so i just treated telos the same way
except for like, kbd
$pet kingblackdragon 100
lol why does it have that in quotes
i'm fixing it
$pet araxxor 800
$pet gwd1 2260
$pet gwd1 2260 hm
barry/mallory
idk i just copied this table
http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Boss_pets
apparently really small numbers break my significant figures formatter
yeah ik how it works
i didn't think there were rots pets
also i'm not gonna put other araxyte pets in, too much work tbh
ah right
$pet kingblackdragon 80
yikes
unfortunately it's "themagister"
lmao
test2
eh close enough
or just use spotify tbh
who gay
L
sec have to take offline
it can't do 2 things at once!
ok offline
the manual one is offline
the way i run the bot is every 10 mins it reruns the auto bot
test
!add test,Working as intended.
test
it's already in there
who gay
lmao
actually i'm gonna move the add function to a dm from me to bot sry all
only me!
nobody else can add
bc i wrote it!!!!
also custom emojis are actually pretty hard to make work
yeet
it's not even a role it's only me
!add test,Working as intended.
sec
offline
!add test,Working as intended.
test
what the
oh lol my name changed!
2 bots running atm
1 is auto-run the other is manual
HAHA
I don't have to edit the code to add stuff now
great success
i wonder
oh i can't do the copypasta bc it has commas
uh
!add welcome,Join Memers Today‚Ñ¢!
welcome
hmm doesn't like the emoji
oh wait oops
sec
!add welcome,Join Memers Today‚Ñ¢!
welcome
double line in file
ofc it only accepts mine
lol
welcome
too much power in any one person's hands except mine
and it should work like you can put the queries anywhere, who gay
hehe
may-mays
ye because i'm fixing it
took offline to make changes
wtf
it's marking everywhere gotta snip snap
raqle
hm
raqle
hmmmmmm
raqle
raqle
guys
prepare to have your minds fucking blown
ok check this out
raxi keeps asking me to put this in

and  have it say gaster rite
but it doesn't! what do
who gay
oh i know
!add who gay,gaster
who gay
$droplist gwd1
$drop gwd1 pet
$drop gwd1 hm pet
I found it!

Haha this is in the docs of the library I use for discord
What the
Globbernaught
What's that smell
I like pip pop tollywock
Rekt
Omg I just had the best idea
A bot command
Than can add new bot command
I'll do it when I'm home
$drop araxxor egg
<@236842111834652672>
Already in there
Oh
Ol
Ok
Yeah good change
Was already on my to-do list but give urself a pat on the back for also thinking about it
:v)
<@236842111834652672> jk good suggestion
Also christianminglee actually made me lol
Also

Imagine getting that mad about pot brownies
Also check this out
Actually
<:reee:358716704475447306>
I'll do that in a bit
Thought of a good way to implement
So that I don't have to have "who gay" in my GitHub repo ha
$drop araxxor pet
Uh
$droplist araxxor
whomst broke telosbot
telosbot back online
$droplist araxxor
$drop araxxor solo leg
need the proper capitalization
let me throw in something to ignore case
offline bot
$bosslist
all lowercase now bc reeee muh capitalization
BUT you can type it in in caps if u want@!!
lol no telos??
oh yeah
i got rid of telos
bc i have a dedicated telos calc
$chance
i edited ur file bc it didn't make sense
u had 540 for avg phys for  enough scraps
but that's not a droprate
i kept in only the things that had actual droprates
bc u can just work out the averages later
alright i'll commit then i'm going to sleep
all bots back up and running
hopefully they don't crash :v)
$bosslist
oops
$bosslist
removed spaces bc *fuck* parsing
$drop GiantMole Clingy Molle
$drop GiantMole Clingy Mole
ok! that's it for me tonight
$droplist RotS
fixing error
$drop Araxxor Pheromone
rough around the edges but it's there
let me put in a thing that lists the drops for a boss
bc it's not super obvious how they're stored in the file
offline atm
hi
$droplist Araxxor
oops
$droplist Araxxor
see? not super clear
pictionary?
$droplist Araxxor
sail i'm not gonna do the math
feel free
just getting the bot commands going
$drop Araxxor Solo Leg
$droplist Mole
oh
offline
i don't make em persistent until they're pretty ok lol
bc the way i make them persistent suppresses output
makes it hard to troubleshoot
offline
yeah about to
too confusing atm
$pet
$pet 700 300 1379
oops didn't like taht one
$pet
$pet 700 300 1379

man virtus is great gear btw
yep no problem it's fun af
night schep
$drop Araxxor Pheremone
not how u spell pheromone apparently
alright try again
$drop Araxxor Pheromone
doesn't like araxyte
well the syntax is <boss> <drop> and i keyed it in as boss: araxxor drop: pheromone
so it's not techincally correct yea
$pet 700 300 1201
$pet 700 300 1300
$pet 700 300 1330
$pet 700 300 1370

let me figure out why
yeah
fixing
ok
this might work
ok
$chance 300 5000 1
$chance 300 -1 1
now for the real test
<@!215610241834811393> i'm making telosbot tell u percent chance of not getting tess
it's just a general pet chance calc w/ thresh
not specific to tess
omg i can actually write a recursive function for this
ye
$chance -10 5.5 100
oops
might have broken it
lmao
<@!381213507997270017> when will <@219515657153282048> stop asking me to make the bot do shit
:^)
haha true
it does wtf u on about
oh wait actually u did remind me of a change to make
uh
0hai
wait don't ask it yet
it's gonna dual report
i think
nah actually it's gud
$chance 1 1 1
oh lol
i stopped it ofc

that's actually a pretty big difference
yeah lotd is 25% enrage
$chance 1 26 0
see
just fuck it up
$chance

schnapps pls
kc?
you're down to a 0.37% chance
of not having gotten tess yet
parks and rec
archer
arrested development
oh nice joke
schep what's the max chance on an individual drop for tess
you need 3000 kills to get a 1/70  chance rite
bc every 300?
or uh 2700 kills w/e
fix what
that was never a thing@
when will i get 90 rc
done
wtf
<@!381213507997270017> when will i get p4e2
got rid of needing "i get"
so now
<@!381213507997270017> when will gyne quit
<@!381213507997270017> when will schep get tess
what the
<@!381213507997270017> when will schep get tess
that's not a command üò†
Ok
Second
<@!381213507997270017> when will i get 90 rc
<@!381213507997270017> when will i get 90 rc
y riot
<@!108682527304060928> why do you say 15%
the thresh is what makes it 0.6%

schep
it's 0.5% now
also I didn't bully you üò†
but
ur chance of getting pet
is increasing with ur kc
tru
yeah
night schep
sup
rude

WoopWoopWoop!
whomst
idk
does schep have tess?
not at all
i wrote it from scratch
currently putting your text doc into a json for bot
Yeah
Also it factors in ur credit score and zodiac sign iirc
Yes
Literally what sail and I were just talking about doing
What language
Let me plug it into the bot
<@108682527304060928> I've worked with Java before shouldn't be too bad
And the other is me!
Aw
Yeah not bad
Sharing is caring
Lmao
/r/murderedbywords
wait
should i not do this until the sw weekend
does weekend buff anima for pushing?
does it even matter on low worlds tho
ok
i'll get to 50 then thx
i just want bladed dive
<@!381213507997270017>
<@!215610241834811393> that's what i said!
ah yeah
ok i'll take that into account later
w1 doesn't seem to be too hard
i'm just trying to get a magic level and get sunspear to 12
when will i get gud
<@!195930082924167168> u can unblock bot now
it doesn't tag u anymore
oh
thought schep said u did
nvm
i mean zuriels + virtus = 76m
wrong
not u
im a learner
i have t87.5 range wep and t70 armor is that enough
ok
wait virtus?
my magic weapon is t80 only
worth using magic even though my weapon is worse?
mmk
gonna have to grind for some $$
Can you carry me at raids schep
Real talk
I do actually want to raid
gotta get started on the ol achto grind
If I twitch irl streamed this dog park I would make millions

australian shepherd
she's the top one
i'm the bottom
ye she's little af
bottle fed her too
not a foster
we pick her up in December
i know

this is my current dog
no üò† theyre gonna be best friends
if u stick a hairbrush up a dogs asshole u shud be shot
tbh
Bc old content
double major not dual degree
there are ppl that get multiple bachelors tho
which is pretty fkin dumb
I've got 6 months left in my master's degree too, which is operations research
yeee
well hopefully lmao
tyty
i want to eventually
phdboye
lol it'll be like
a lot of years
ooh maybe i should put droprate calc in bot
fuck around with numpy
oWo
alright guys i gotta take my dog to the dog park
then I will be back to play all day!
rip life
but wait before i go what's that smell
ehehehe
i'm about 2 get my 2nd dog actually
u guys wanna see a picture of me holding my new dog
oWo
is 0.00624
So that's 0.6%
like <@!236842111834652672> said it's a binomial distribution
just like
a couple of them multiplied together
break? wym
uh no

i mean if ur calculator sucks maybe
haha no worries
you can rewrite the above as

you could also use a geometric distribution to figure out the chances of schep getting his first tess drop as his next drop
all you need really
geometric is basically an iterated bernoulli trial just like binomial
but a bit different in what u calculate
uhh i think so
post again tho pls fuck that guy
lel
Does schep have tess
<@!381213507997270017> I removed the <@!381213507997270017> from the bot so it won't <@!381213507997270017> u anymore
wot
<@!215610241834811393> I removed the <@!215610241834811393> from the bot so it won't <@!215610241834811393> u anymore
what's that smell tho
üò†
wtf
bc of how i wrote it
if message.content.lower() == "what's that smell"
i could do if "what's that smell" in message.content.lower()
but wait dylie what's that smell
python
yeah there's a nice python wrapper for discord api
there's a js one too but idk js
yeah ik it's ez but I just know python super well
not worth the time to learn a new language if i don't need to
except haskell, i'm learning that bc it's cool af
nah he's chillin
it's a functional programming language
I was in undergrad yea
that's not my bot
!
I got bachelors in math and cs
<-----------------------------------------------------------------
uh
didn't point to my name rip
bc I like math! ok!
ok so it seems like
the probability that you *haven't* gotten tess
I will remove mentions!
Nice you boys doin a bit of calculating
Yeah u got it
What's the thresh for Tess
What's the chance after thresh??
When will I get tess
More than 9 thresholds? So at 300 it's 2/700 then at 400 it's 3/700 etc?
Every 300 got it
Ok give me a sec
Username btw
What's your kc
aight i'm going to bed
2:30am here too lol
see ya
i need to make some bigger changes to the bot
I'll add a toggle to tagging so that it doesn't happen constantly
i'll figure out the self-rate-limiting too
eh sort of ha
you should see the bot I made for my destiny clan
that thing is awesome
yea i play a lot more rs nowadays
games not hot
it's a lot more fun in a group
destiny raids are actually awesome
solo is grindy and meh
yeah same
ooh punisher out today
or yesterday
haha thanks man
cya
yeet
ps4
you on ps4 or xbox?
dang :/
i'm in the same boat though, burnt out atm but ready for the DLC
I know :/
nothing to grind for anymore
i know üò¶
i miss my matador and sidearm spam
d1 crucible was just so much faster
lol i actually got pretty good towards the end of y3
dang you missed out
y3 was amazing
ton of qol updates, great content
all the raids brought up to light level
yeah it was a blast
the newest one, wotm, was my favorite
oryx was my first raid, i started playing in y2
eventually got to do em all at light level
but oryx holds a special place in my heart lol
i blind raided wrath which was awesome
i feel the same way about blind wrath, except for the previous raids part
by far the most fun I've ever had in a game
blind raid in D2 was still fun but not as much
yeah
It's ok, I don't love it though
I really like the design of the underbelly tho
enormous but still interesting
my teams always just go through the main part
yeahh idk
weird design choice
consistent raid groups are the best
i really don't mind it's ez
ok
y so mean to raqle tho
l0l
put 'em in a list lmao
as long as it's not firing off every time anyone says anything lol
yeah
hmm maybe it should only respond some of the time
put a random number generator on whether or not it'll ignore a comment ha
uhh maybe
that would take a little work but ye good idea
what's that smell tho
cmon memebot
lel
i will figure out how to do it
just a matter of how long it takes
when will i get this right bot
YES
FUCKING YES
I actually can't believe that worked lmfao
when will i get tess tho
it's keyed into "when will i get"
i'll drop the get
yea good point i'll leave as is
oWo
i better not put this on github
oops forgot that one
my b
try
markdonalds
the code has a shit ton of hardcoded user ids lmao
better not upload that
yeah
really easy to add/remove shit too so we can keep it fresj
fresh
2 instances of bot running atm top kek

i make all my bots extra racist
wym capbot died
bots die from xx:x0 until xx:x2 ish
every 10 minutes they reboot to check alogs

wait real question

uh
does schep have tess yet
ah right
OK
does schep have tess
does schep have tess yet
did schep get tess
I am become death, destroyer of worlds
<@!215610241834811393> add my bot pls

DELET*****
gyna
gyne
do the navy seals copypasta
do it
rip me
u can't delet!!!!
bruh
lmfao
skep
everyone DELETE
<@!215610241834811393> the schepbot is done put in server pls
I KNEW IT
I WAS RIGHT
get fucked
admin coup
<@!215610241834811393>
oh ya
uh sec
haha it tags schep now
wtf is happening
HAHAHA
yeah this is amazing
raxi say something
lmfao
ü§∞
raxi type john madden
#ivoted
I nominate myself
<@!215610241834811393> there was a bug in bot that I fixed last night
it auto posts now üëç
pesticide is called "don't use crontab bc it sucks"
wtf did i miss 99 party
the only thing darker than my heart is my past
yes pls
not bad not bad
how many kills up to this point?
and related how many do you think it'll take to reach goal
2m/kill regular = 2m in regular loot or 2m regularly per kill
gotcha
nex
not anymore

schep i call uniques
no call backs
no like
i get them
yep i said no callbacks
cap inc
ok fine i will take anything that isn't unique
oh wait nvm i have to log out
that's the goal?
nice, how close are you?
why does rs hate 4k
too many bots in here
beep boop
it's got to be channel specific permissions like you were saying
that's annoying af
what if you have like a hundred channels smh
i suppose you could auto assign a @speak role or something
I will write a bot to do that and u cant stop me
haha true
what if i write a bot to write bots
sounds too complicated
i'll just write a bot that'll write that bot
ye wtf was that
lmao
Don't you inherit the highest level permissions you have
So just disallowing send messages and specifically reallowing only in bots should work
I do that on my server
I don't think you need to though
oh wait nvm
i thought i had my shit figured out but i guess not
yeah i guess it is permissions in every server
channel*
that's annoying
Tfw lotd bug lets u easily make a ton of money but ur too poor to own a lotd anyways
Not that I would ever abuse a bug smh

Panic buy nex sets I guess
i get 50m?
<@!215610241834811393> are you saying those cost you 50m
oh dang tyvm
yeah i was gonna say lol
i'm actually about to post to see if the rss feed 404s is a known issue
like if that wasn't a thing the bot would work perfectly
gzzzzzzzz
<@!236842111834652672> it's also the fact that alogs just stop working if you try to pull too many in a short amount of time
idk why
it's annoying af
so i randomize the order in which I pull players to try and get everyone cycled through successful runs as much as possible
lol gotcha
it should only work in cappinglog
yea
i'm going to disable it good call
ye good call disabled
It's 50m though!!!
wot
bot isn't even turned on smh
that physically hurts
I use a touch pad
Who got rid of my [maxed]
Thx m8
That's a lot of gps
<@136806558901207040> I'm a little too drunk to finish the bot my b

Gz on vind title
I'd say approximately 32.33, repeating of course
R.I.P.
unless you cap and then do enough other shit to push it off the alog
in between updates
ye
if you can that's pretty impressive tbh
not until it works tbh
never used crontab b4 cross ur fingers
heyyy it works
<@283342904016109569> nice cap btw
Also ty for testing my bot tbh pretty hard to test when the only trigger is capping
Same
is there a cap on clan size in rs
ty

note that this is wrong if #1. your adventurer's log is private
#2. you've done enough other shit recently that your cap fell off the end
i decided to write a bot that generates random raffle winners
here's a preview of a bunch of completely random trials

it's random what can i say
ps if your adventurers log is private y tho
nope
well sort of
historical data no
what the bot will do is just bong discord every time someone caps
with your current name
ackshually it already does that
but uh i was going to  add historical cap stuff
but with everyone changing names that sounds like too much work so
it'll just bong
and also this

but like i said if your adv log is private i can't track you
it checks everyones adv logs every 15 mins to see if you capped
yea that's a problem too
but from now on it'll work

why do we not show up in clan search wtf
only within the scope of your adventurer's log atm
but still

So you did write it
My favorite part is the guy complaining about how hard mastermind was
Apparently unless I value my time at 11m/hr it's more efficient to do bloods instead of souls from 90-99
That sucks
Right
Yeah. Working on it nothing to show yet
Yeah python. I'll throw it on my GitHub when I have something workable

what about bro jobs? did they mention bro jobs?
asking for a friend
the barrows drop table implies that killing all brothers gives a 0% chance of getting a defender
"If this fails, we then see if the player is eligible for a defender drop and if they are you have a 50 x (7 - Number of Brothers killed) chance of obtaining a defender."
there are 7 brothers
"The number of Brothers that you kill, including Akrisae but excluding Linza"
6 - Akrisae
5 - Verac
4 - Torag
3 - Karil
2 - Guthan
1 - Dharok
0 - Ahrim
