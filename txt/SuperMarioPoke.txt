wtf
it was on a guide video for kril walking
why does he have that at krill wtff
o
maybe
tyty
never got that on main
i should work on that for iron huh
time to stream some duo rots attempts. first kill was yesterday lmao
schep lmk if u want to boss later tn
been learning a bit of everything
kgd?
dude
these last 30 scraps
huh
how m uch is the aura
also magister update is lit as f
sub 1 min kills now
it doesnt override completly
u can get the dev2 proc seperate, if ed3 happens it overrides
but its still more devo uptime
unless someone lied to me
fuck
imp3dev2 is aids to get
ive failed it so many times i dont believe it exists anymore
and now im broke
reeee
oh rip clan ded
today was good tho
got my first p4e2
~300-350 gizmos
who wants to join the drinking game
a drink for ever 99 120 and pet in a skill your getting xp in (or leveling items for invention)
and a drink for any 200m
if the 200m is in your skill its 2 drinks
oh nice
how much is it
ok ill probably get it once i hit f3
i only have f2 atm
also i think i would need to get more illuj rip
if i need just 1 is doing the emblem worth it
the uh
zxarossian essence
or should i just diss a body
i could also do as1pf with it instead
ive done that so many times now rip
?
Ive put aftershock on like 4 weapons and also have 2 as1pf switches
flanking 3 on a staff is something im down with tho, so i would put an as perk on it
lool
on a good night thats a lot of bonds/hr
oh jack
yo ucould also
put a tormented demon in your slayer dungeon
and afk killing 1 demon until you get bow
o
rip
ill think of afk stuff in bed
bbl
so like aod when teams are sketch lool
i might go for it
but im kinda itchen for telos rn
kinda sad tho how dormant staff is so much
i mean i made my nox by getting the eye and then buying a leg
so i was hoping to do that with orbs
but for sos you need like 2 sets of orbs
1 to make 1b
the seocnd to buy a dormant staff
lel
im hoping to hit one
pay for prayers first
even though staff is soooo much cooler
but what ill do is get prayer and sigil with a my first bil drop at telos
that way i feel cooler while having the prayer
althuogh  i might just commit to magic
get prayer and dsos
then get orbs
then get money for other prayers
idk
ill be back tho ima take a nap then run my errand
hopefully iwake up in 2 hours
yea
i have a good one
never slept through witrhout turning it off first lol
btw if you ever want to aod and dont mind se lure and like 8-9 minute 7 mans
i can invite you when we need a +1
divination
or sit in world 2
buy gold bars
then buy cursed energy/incan
and make divine charge
pretty afk
idk thats the most afk i can think off
for decent money
idk
gold bars are fast
but worse than harrilandar tar
but not by enough for me to care
since i can buy both
just get 10k harralander tar and 10k gold bars
or w/e limit
lol
and your like oh shit theres the road
wow
i kinda want to do magister once i get 115 s
but kopesh is kinda not that much now
like it feeeels like its not great but people say its still good
im still i think 10 or 15m xp off
i did
iirc like average 500 a weapon?
but the weapon isnt much now
when i looked them up I thought htey were like 1b each so i was like omg
but i think they are a few hundred mil?
oh
weird question tho
how fast is he compared to vindy
also its cause of titles imo
so less afk
but a lance is like 1-400  right
i forget
but i feel like its 1 drop every few hours
at vindy
so magister is kinda like actual effort but instead of alance you get 280 mil
do normal drops make gp/hr or just pay for  keys
ohrip
i want the sigil so bad
even if i dont use it
just to fill in the slot
lol
also cause it could be clutch in p4 when i need the reflect and i used my adren
yea i noticed i would res too early sometimes i think
ive been guthix staffing right as i finish a phase
ah ive beend oing reflect revenge anti corruption lol
or ive been doing cade and kill the red guy with ss on
like if the power meter is high
i think you can cade and block both?
can you still cade the font damage or just right before the reset
ah nice
and yes i have t3
first t3 took 2 gizmos
second 45
lo
yea i need more gizmo parts now
but i have the magic shield with t3 i dont need much else atm
since i just do aod telos and slayer
although ill be doing some nex soon to go for defenders
although no one uses them :/
i thought they were good at telos
yea
so now im kinda going for t99 prayers
but also spending like 50-100m for overloads on dxp
just to have supplies and if im going to make ovls i should do it on dxp
yea
a few holys tho too
and adren restores
i will
im debating if im taking a nap or not atm
when is the deadline
yea
since 2pm
my schedule is fucked
so i wanted to fix
but i might take a nap
but i need to be somewhere in 2 hour
then i work 2-6 tomorrow
i just started getting tired
i spend like 4 hours at aod not using my acc aura
so i coudl telos
then i never went lol
1 cause scared of p5 even though im just going to do up to 100 now
and 2 cause i wasnt tired enough to sleep
but tired enough to not telos
fuck tho i want t99/sos so badly but its going to take a while.  the codex split was encouraging tho
its only 640m now
yea
lol
like when you drive for too long
yea but ill use yak for safety while i learn
then ill start using nihil once i stop need ing food
how many brews?
also is seis super needed or can i get by with as1pf cywrir wand when i shield swap
why do i feel like you have so much more room
let me check what mine is
is that a god cape
oh is that your iron?
ah
https://gyazo.com/4ddae1f14514b5226b0d36d8d6b17773
thats also not bad
money if you dont die
yea
yak is only rock
oh use dps stuff till higher enrage?
ive never used ahcto before so i was excited to try it
and deathtouch works?
yea
i finally got some resses but i do need to work on 50-100 more
oh wow
and if i have to font ill just immortality
my issue atm
is when i end p4
pre 100
im low as f on food
before p4
its like 5050
p4 its like i forget where the rotation is
i should look up p4 rotation cause i think it changes
yea let me save that
anima ball is the weird thing right
that drains ovls if you dont stand in font?
im starting to
honestly i might streak 0-100 once or twice to get better at it
or 50-100
maybe thats better
yea i play cello and scales are important :p
the basics
ect
should i do 50-100 until i dont need my yak
like could you do it with no familiar
like no nihil dps
but no yak
