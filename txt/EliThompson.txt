Hello
why is pet bot not working?
Eli trying to sleep b/c he has the flu. You all can deal with him in the mean time.
I know someone who’s clan  world is 42. They’re in “ash”
But why
oh raxi
those headphones you sent me are totally wired
yeah that's fine.  I found some cheap enough ones that look fine.
oh yeah, the other shit.  they're great!!
shit raxi I just realized that the headphones you showed me are wired, I was looking for wireless D=
and those are good headphones?  or at least a good maker?
alright, thank you very much
Thoughts on this update? I think it's good tbh.
Who gay?
<@!307200844078645258> bot says different
feelsbadman
685 kc rn.  let's see how long it takes to complete the log
Does anyone have a revo++ bar for graardor?  I need a new afk boss for at work
I figured melee
How or why would you take all of that into wildy?
and so their "lure" was making the dude think it'd be a fair fight but having a bunch of dudes standing on the same space?
<@!136806558901207040> I totally capped
That means I'm in for the raffle, right?
rip
I guess I could just have it done manually.
$pet 333 1000 100
so that'd be 100 hard mode kills after 2k regular mode, not taking into account regular mode miss percentage
$pet gwd1 2000
$pet gwd 2000
rip
I thought bot was back?
but telosbot was back
<@!195930082924167168> they finally addressed the hit box for transmorgified stuff
Hey math, is there any way to adjust it for gwd1 to where you can put in your thresh level and your hm kc to get a rate?
like if I wanna check 100 hm kills but I have thousands of regular kills
yes
but it'd be very specific?
Like it'd require you to keep track of the order for it to be accurate?
Alright.  I'm bout to switch to hard mode for zily b/c I'm about to get to second thresh
prob close enough
$pet 1000 1000 2100
that's not quite right
hmmm
So according to that post, it’d take me 194 hours of ge rc to get rue.
Since at 99 it’s 48xp per drop, a drop every 2.4 seconds, modifier of 28, and virtual level 100.
If abyss rc bonus does count toward base do for pet, that’s about 94k per full crafting at 99 without urns. Divide that by 28 and you get ~3357. So just do that times virtual level divided by 50m to get chance or the inverse of that answer to get the number of full crafts it should take.
So for me that’s about 149 crafts on full soul altar or around 37.5 more hours.
I don’t know if sarcasm or not. I can math out bloods later.
The biggest issue I'm having rn calculating rue pet chance is that wiki only gives xp per hour thorugh abyss, not per drop.  But if you want to figure it out on your own, it's [(base xp per drop which according to milow includes abyss bonus but excludes demonic skull)/28*virtual level or 320 if you're 200m]/50m
yeah that
so that's over 100k/drop from souls through abyss with skull.  at 100 rc (me) that's about 140 trips to hit the 1/x chance
or around .7% chance each drop at 100 rc
and around .86% each drop at 120 rc
but a ~2.28% chance each drop at 200m
there's even a bot that agrees that woahmens is a dumb name
it doesn't do what I tell it to
So just to confirm the post in announcements is bs, right?
hmmm
I don't know if I believe
but I guess I'll wait and see
also memers is such a better name than whoamens
or whatver it is
Woahmens
so have them join you
memers better name
what level cit do they have?
well you should def have them join memers instead of joining woahmens b/c that's a dumb name
gosh schep
significant others
well at least a little bit
s/o
yes
that's how you do it in american
exactly^
only if you ask nicely 😉
now you see that's wrong though
😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉
I'm totally gonna fall asleep in my class
I'm so tired
😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉 😉
rip
message was deleted
what are those
so wait schep is an actual thing?
o shit

I don't know what kind of scheps those are though
they don't look like ones near me
student pretty sure
hi schep
and is it bad that I started typing "stupid" instead of "student"
SEE I KNOW ABOUT MY S/OS
I'm always in for raids as long as I'm not busy irl
I know not clannie but still
Also need to learn jw so schep doesn't reeeee at me again
<@348616637965926401> I have class from 1330 game time to 1520, but I'm free after that.  or like right now.
but wouldn't that be backwards?
But....... god people are stupid
Works for me.  I'll let you know when I'm free.
just wants to make sur eno one kills them
did you all walk to kbd lair too?
I don’t think it takes into account the threshold from the normal mode kills.
$pet hm gwd1 3376
That’s more like it
Threshold for both is 1000, correct?
Both modes?
So what’s the new meme going to be now that schep got Tess and raxi got Ralph? Yeah milow doesn’t have ace but he doesn’t bitch about it enough for it to@be funny. I don’t have kc high enough to complain about zily pet yet. Raxi and chickarra is all I can think of. Any others?
what bossing is being done?
<@!215610241834811393> share I gled yesterday and gave rocktail soups
no?
$pet telos 1794
gz schep
those odds
that's funny
I like little things like that
yes, I want you dylie
right chat
does the bot have a hard mode calculator?
$gwd1 hm 1000
$pet gwd1 1000
gotta unlock it first.
I'm using cywir wand right now.  is that not good enough?
So that’s a yes. I was also told that it and orb are for applying debuffs since de autos are much faster than staff so more chances to apply.
but that's pretty secondary to just shield dps/basing?  and can use flanking switch (virt book) for now?
I need to spooder but I have school work
urg
less than a day and a half more of spooder that I'll do
$pet gwd1 1000
it's gonna take me forever to get zily title...
$pet gwd1 2000
Is it worth getting seismic wand and augmenting it if I don't have off-hand nor as3 to put on it yet?
what's the vial?
Fuck off memebot
hey it worked, just delayed
Hey schep can you send me your setups for telos?
if I watch guides and shit, how hard is sub 100 with nihil?
But I want to say both
But probably yak to start
Hey <@!288667307356454912> what's your setup for telos?
no with a good weapon
also I realized that I didn't actually have a pxex on my nox staff for the past months
I've been using it with just as3...
so I have nox, crweyre wand for pf switch and shield with t3 on it
and aug t88 armor
the damage scrim yeh?
so all I'm missing from that list is dreadnips
I have the rest at least most of the time
man if I get telos sub 100% enrage
*get tess
maybe I'll try a kill or two instead of going to raxi with maniacal
I totally forgot that bot does that...
rip
is gameblast hosted by jagex or... not?
I mean I don't know these things
I'm really not trying to be funny....
I...
alright.
I still didn't get a straight response btw.  Is gameblast hosted by jagex or does jagex just always have dxpw/some event over gameblast
Okay, so it's a nonprofit or something and major game studios/twitch based in the UK and Jagex has dxpws over the weekend to raise awareness/money
start stocking up!!!!
or selling since everyone else is gonna be stocking up
also source?
so that's gameblast, it doesn't mention dxpw though
Probably but I'm almost 26 so it's pretty awkward to get diagnosed now
Please explain instead of just being insulting
pet chance bot is borken and is making me sad
Okay, I have given up caring because apparently I can’t get any new pets.
Hey schep wanna raid in like 10 minutes?
You’re not schep.
So is that a yes or a no?
Okay. Well I’m taking my dog for a walk and I’ll be free. Should be less than 10 minutes.
That’s fine. I just unlocked so I have two resets anyway
Plus I really should go to sleep. I have work in like five hours and have been awake for 24
Cob is currently a clannie of mine
no
speaking of jew fro, I need a haircut soon
reported asking for updoots
So imma head off and be back on later
not a case study, have to read an article and basically summarize it
damn, a clannie just got bm pet, now has both bm and yaka pet at under 100 kc
^
well
national debt is a decent thing
but citizens having so much debt isn't as much
though having debt b/c we give the richest amongst us tax breaks isn't the best option
b/c ofc trickle down economics works amiright?
well they did give us trump
man I barely remember a time pre-putin
Luxembourg D=
alright I love you all and I enjoy this kind of conversation but I really need to be finishing an essay on presidential character
but you find a middle aged hispanic person from cuba or mexico or central america
they'll work their ass off for $10 an hour
yeah, those who bitch about other races do 😛
dolebludgers?
no...
I've neber heard that term
I understand enough where it comes from but.....
idk I think it's used as an insult more than anything
like I agree that people should be allowed to identify how they want.  I think some of them might go overboard, but hey you do you boo
I think that attacking others for being their gender/race is dumb
you right that is really bad
what fake problems do you think they have?
I would argue that they are
you right
I'm not saying you are, but arguing that a minority isn't discriminated against tends to lead to sounding racist, even if unintentional
I think we should stop before this gets heated b/c I still think they are
maybe not by you or me, but anti-discrimination laws are still needed
I think those blacks get into the sjw area
the loud minority
so do poor white republicans 😛
that's a lower class thing
^
you know what race I've found doesn't like to be seen as victims
hispanics
I especially immigrants
like some of the younger hooder ones aren't the best
define classic liberal
well what would you say are the "core libearl values"?
I agree
I think everyone who is of sound mind and free from the criminal background should be given the chance to own a gun
<@!215610241834811393> jew btw
And I agree with luke that it's not my business
btw I hate the term sjw.
florida is more right leaning, virginia is more left leaning, and nc is all kinds of fucked up
I think the establisment democrats have lost their way
Tbh I think there needs to be 4 political parties
the sanders democrats, the clintonites, the romney republicans, and the tea partiers/trumpers
totally don't let me fix Romney's name
tbh I don't think they've let sjws take over the party.  they may be a loud part, but if you look at those in office, I would argue that they are far from sjw
you right, but they don't view themselves that way, it's cognitive disonance that makes them vote against their self interest
I've done a lot of reading/research about this since I am going to get into politics
you right
I like retarted better.  There are a lot of them just too ignorant to realize that they are just hurting themselves
become president
no like actually
I can understand some liberatarian ideals and I think it'd be nice, but I feel that the free market doesn't work with that little regulation
same^
"what is allepo?!"
nah but I still have a ways to go.  still gotta figure out if I'm gonna start my political career in florida, nc, or va
I consider myself a moderate democrat
yes dyli
disable it through e-mail and reenable it on new phone
I had to do that when I switched phones too
ironmen are republicans b/c they do everything for themselves
they think no one should get handouts b/c they don't need
no, there are just "temporarily embarassed millionaire" republicans
that's how they view themselves
now then just need to raise max cash so dyes and shit can get fair prices
also


extremes are just extreme X for all
so





why jagex
literally 5 pictures
supers
attack, strength, def are just super X
ranging and magic are super X potion
jagex, y
literally unplayable
oh
isn't yanille lode faster?
that's what I usually do for that palm
and yeah lotd is fast for spirit tree which you can get to tree gnome and brim palm
and for ease you can spirit tree to gnome place north of yanille and have the dude lead you out of maze and boom right htere
I know it first you say adamantly distance and you use freedom anticipated some point to make sure that you don’t get dragged into the middle. I know that during shadow phase you move when a shadow is under you. I know during blood phase you sit use bleeds at some point and you don’t attack (I think) when she says a siphon will solve this.
Hu
Hi
How hard is it to actually solo nex and and make profit?
Solo kills are what? Between three and five minutes?
Like me
Who sucks
Like 20 or so, yeah. Doesn’t mean know what I’m doing. I know not to use bleeds on one part and on the first part to keep moving so that I don’t get hit by shadows.
Actually come to think of it I probably know at least a fair amount of what I’m doing.
Seeds
Depends on if you’re using lunar spells or not.
You can use lunar spells instead of carrying super compost, and you can also use them to skip growth steps for most things. Are you only doing trees or are you doing herbs as well?
Why slayer cape for trees? That only helps you with the tav one
Otherwise luck of the dwarves is better because you can use it to get to spirit trees east
Easy
Also remember that it’s only worth paying for protection on palm trees. And you can use noted items to pay for it, they don’t have to be unnoted
It’s better just to use the Crystal teleport seed since you can use it to get to trah for magic and meil for palm. If you really want to, you can use it to get to the herb patch in crwys too
Plus it gets you to the palm tree patch in llyeta

that legacy interface D=
that's actually a thing?
hmmmmm
I need to check that out b/c I'm looking for a new boss to afk while at work
whta wep?  scythe?
that seems really good
why don't more poeple do that?
also glue said to meet him in the schep zone.  no idea what he's talking about
do you pray anything or no?
Excuse me, can we keep this chat in American to be inclusive of all here?  I'm getting pretty tired of this socialism speak.
none of that job stealer speak either.  We don't need no wall hoppers here either.  Just good ol' American speak.
alright so google translate says that's icelandic but it's translation in english is  the same, but in portuguese it means "I was there".  so fuck if I know.  I understand just enough mexispeak to tell them not to steal my stuff when they cut my lawn.
ooo neat
I like how the picture dictionary shows a black guy in a fighter pilot's helmet giving a thumbs up but it looks like he's in pain for some reason....
Schep's back on the market?!
Hi schep  =]
oh question to people, was it a waste of time and money to spendlike 3 hours in abyss using 4k bloods and 12k fires and all of my div charges trying for pets and using scav3?
yah I know you think that but I don't have 43m tyvm
I have like.... 300k rn...
I did for the first part but then I needed something more afk
also I used like 6 aggro flasks...
http://i.runescape.com/ct/51985225:61QRk9yLN:m:1:2735266367:3FBD01E5862D3879D961F791BC44F8D0:r:312734703
rs survey, might link to me though so idk
<@!327655882207002625>
the max cape isn't necessary, that's infinity ethereal but any full outfit works (I used law ethereal while maxing).  that's combined catalyst frag, wildy sword, tokkul-zo, and demonic skull.  all 5 pouches
what's missing is urns and urn enhancer.  you want those b/c they add like 15k per harvest.
it's 11 unstarted and one started
def, free tele to edgeville
well, not needed but super helpful
and abyssal titan with 20 ess as well
urns at least (and enhancer if you can) are needed though
and catalyst allows pouches to stay longer without degrading
oh?
you only have 3 slots if you have infinity outfit btw
and you never explained what necklace does so I never used it, that woulda helped a shit ton 😛
if you don't have infinity then you can only carry 94/95

<@!215610241834811393> "Well if you would have told me why you needed it"
Just saying 😛
yall fuckers dont' have a "drops achievements" channel
so:

I'd still rather have a combat pet tbh
gg
$pet yaka 18
$pet kbd 589

so are you guys actually racist or?
<@!136806558901207040> you joining us or no?
yah it's clan "killing vindy for an hour"
no cheq
huh?
it's talking?
how do I get it to stop?
stahp it

though my grouops isn't much better...
<@!293219528450637824> SMH GO ALREADY
he just came
did you just go offline <@!215610241834811393> ?
ard good
You are buying Tess for 1b, remember? I’m giving you my luck and you will get Tess before I max.
Fuck if I know. You’re just waiting to finish up when I’m online?
Rip. I actually had some hope that I could pull out the upset. I got 99 rc and dung last night and I’m less than 2m from 99 hunter.
Yeah yeah 😛
Schep when are you telosing next?
Well technically I don’t have 99 dung yet. I’m 143k away but I have a completed extended daily to turn in. I was gonna a get hunter and then max in prif.
How many hours from now is tonight for you?
Because it’s 10:30 AM where I am
That’s no excuse.
Twitch mobile, duh
Okay.  Please let me know when you wake up.  I'm not gonna max before you either, you won fair and square =]
schep please stream so I have something better to watch while I catch tortles than bs aod
hmmm?
who is bullying you?
I'm not acatually paying attention to chat btw
Sorry I was helping a guest make a reservation
coiz you should keep bothering schep
schep you should kick coiz from everything so she is sad and won't get on rs and skill
<@!293219528450637824> <@!215610241834811393>
but it's coiz
also you should cloak yourself in the aura of maniacle and go kill telos
turns out I'm cooking at soul altar
I don’t have full ethereal, so I’m only bringing 95 essence per trip.
I only have one set, not infinity.
Schep
You’re supposed to not do that.
"Please take me in the alley behind with your e-peen"

thank you
and with that I have turned notifications to only mentions
