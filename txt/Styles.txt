selling warden
wut
<@170499876235247616> 3 wardens 300 melons

no with t99 and t92 thats just plain suck
no splash excuses
ye u are suck

insane final warden
the point is to not be at start of p3 at 3:44
so what
haha lit
lets light the jews up that will be lit
yuck
u know what the jews are the best at
being a fertilizer

look at how many jmods left jagex this + past year
and we dont see any new ones introduced other than a couple
one which made the memorial to guthix or w/e
only know that one from new jmods tbh
and people are leaving left and right
nobody even understands what the fuck is happening in rs3
u only see jmods leaving and posting on reddit
u dont see a single new jmod introducing themselves
just gonna assume not many people would be up to the task of learning jagex spaghetti code anyways
new jmods i mean
yeah but people still know java its not dead
itsj ust that they fucked it up so many times before
now u dont understand what the fuck is going on
u dont even dmaage fonts directly
what kind of meme is that
how can they not complain if its not worth skilling unless u get over 1.6m xp/h
if u can do telos efficiently
its weird
it doesn't no
but people like to compete
like i'd prob spin my xp as well for 120 slay/dg if i wanted comp
but i understand where the frustration comes from
highscore exist
its more about lacking updates while th gets multiple promos a week
people wouldnt be mad if this years updates werent so shit + no weekly th promos
which is what has been happening all year
and theyre pumping those promos out while old jmods are quitting jagex
getting less and less devs on stuff
but the inquiry was about th not the overall game
thats where the confusion comes from
if u get a black drag task u could prob get qbd title with a royal
why would u ever go for qbd seasonal with dragonbanes!!!!!!!!!!!
i did with rax arrows offtask and got 59s
u could do on task with royal and get faster than that
no its still lower than t90 arrow
u dont need some fancy ass mouse to pvm
side buttons are uncomfortable as fuck when u do stuff other than rs
i meant like naga and scimitar and shit
where the buttons completely cover the side
range would still be better than mage even on task
cause u could do that teleportation prism
from seren spells
nox?
how would i know who got scammed for what tbh
idk names
ghyne - Today at 2:15 PM

how would i know
<@!215610241834811393>
