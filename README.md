# MemersMarkov

A poor implementation of a Markov chain for some Discord server about a small clan in a British fantasy game.

Built using **markovify**: https://github.com/jsvine/markovify.

This code is meant to be used with [this](https://github.com/roscroft/math-bot) discord bot, with this program placed in the `./subs/` directory of that program.
